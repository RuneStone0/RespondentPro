description: Rule to guide agents to always avoid building UI that causes a full page refresh.

# Overview

When building web UI components in our Flask application, avoid full page reloads whenever possible to deliver a smooth, modern user experience. Prefer client-side updates using techniques such as:

* Fetching data via fetch() or HTMX and updating the DOM dynamically
* Rendering partial templates and injecting them into the page (e.g., via HTMX hx-swap, Turbo, or custom JavaScript)
* Using Flask endpoints that return JSON or HTML fragments instead of full page renders

Full page refreshes (i.e., traditional form submissions or links that trigger complete reloads) are allowed only when strictly necessary, such as:

* Initial page load
* Authentication flows (login/logout redirects)
* Critical error pages (e.g., 403, 404, 500)
* Cases where client-side updates would add unnecessary complexity or risk

Always consider whether the interaction can be made partial/spa-like before defaulting to a full reload.
